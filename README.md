# MISPSO-Attack
This is the Pytorch code for our paper “MISPSO-Attack: An Efficient Adversarial Watermarking Attack Based on Multiple Initial Solution Particle Swarm Optimization”.

Pretrained weights at Aliyun Drive: https://www.aliyundrive.com/s/UcKWpgwtJeu

All datasets' url have been marked in our manuscript.

IF you download Imagenet or Imagenet-mini (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ifigotin/imagenetmini-1000), pls change the "data_dir" in the code to your path.
Every datasets should have a same structure like this:
dataset
-datasets name
 --class 1
   ---pic001
   ---pic002
   ---pic003
